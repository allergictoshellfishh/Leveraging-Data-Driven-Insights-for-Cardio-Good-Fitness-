# Leveraging-Data-Driven-Insights-for-Cardio-Good-Fitness-

This project focuses on data preparation, exploration, visualisation, and data storytelling using Python in Jupyter Notebook. Using the Cardio Good Fitness dataset, the objective was to analyse customer and product patterns related to treadmill purchases and translate analytical findings into meaningful visual insights for business decision-making.

The assignment involved cleaning and preparing the dataset programmatically, followed by exploratory data analysis to understand customer demographics, fitness behaviour, and purchasing trends. Declarative and exploratory questions were formulated to guide the analysis and ensure insights remained aligned with business objectives.

A range of univariate and multivariate visualisations were created to examine distributions, comparisons, and relationships across different treadmill product lines. These visual findings were then consolidated into dashboards designed to communicate insights clearly and effectively to a target business audience.

Overall, this project strengthened my skills in analytical thinking, data storytelling, and visual communication, as well as my ability to use Python-based tools to support data-driven decision-making.
